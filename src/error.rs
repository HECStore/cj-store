//! # Structured error types for store operations
//!
//! Historically every handler returned `Result<T, String>`, which made error
//! categorization impossible: call sites could not distinguish "user typed a
//! bad item name" from "bot crashed mid-trade". `StoreError` is the typed
//! hierarchy so higher-level code can match on the cause and react
//! appropriately (retry, notify player, escalate to operator, etc.).
//!
//! There is intentionally **no** `From<StoreError> for String` and **no**
//! `From<String> for StoreError`: the former silently smuggled raw error
//! text (including stringified `reqwest::Error` content) through `?` into
//! `Result<_, String>` boundaries, defeating `user_message()`'s
//! sanitization; the latter would collapse every legacy error into
//! `ValidationError` regardless of its real category, hiding the migration
//! work we already did to give errors meaningful types. Player-facing
//! rendering goes through [`StoreError::user_message`] (preferably via
//! [`crate::store::utils::whisper_error_to_player`]); cross-boundary
//! conversion from typed Mojang-resolver errors goes through
//! [`From<MojangResolveError> for StoreError`].
